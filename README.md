## Satellite Virtual Network Functions Optimization
Satellite CubeSats are small, low-cost satellites that are often used for research, educational purposes, and technology demonstrations. They can also be used for various applications, such as remote sensing, Earth observation, and communication.
<br>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are two technologies that can be used in conjunction with CubeSats to enable more flexible and efficient satellite networking. SDN allows for the centralized management and control of network resources, while NFV enables the virtualization of network functions such as routing, firewalling, and load balancing.
<br>The purpose of using SDN and NFV in satellite CubeSats is to increase the agility and scalability of the satellite network, while reducing costs and simplifying operations. With SDN, network administrators can dynamically allocate resources and optimize network performance in real-time. NFV allows for the deployment of virtual network functions on demand, which can reduce the need for dedicated hardware and lower costs.

**Open Issues**
<br>
There are several potential drawbacks to using Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on CubeSat:
<ul>
    <li>Limited resources: CubeSat typically nave limited computational and memory resources which can make it challenging to deploy and run VNFs Running complex VNFs can require significant processing power which may not be available on a satellite platform.</li>
    <li>High latency: CubeSat based communication can have high latency due to the long distance between the CubeSat and the ground station. This latency can impact the performance of VNFs especially those that require real time processing or low latency communication.</li>
    <li>Limited connectivity: CubeSats may experience intermittent or disrupted connectivity due to factors such as weather conditions or line-of sight obstructions. This can cause issues with VNF availability and performance, especially for applications that require constant connectivity.</li>
</ul>
<br>
How to solve them
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Define the problem requirements Identify the objectives of the optimization, the constraints, and the performance metrics</li>
    <li>Define the architecture Determine the architecture of the system, including the number of satellites and VNFs, the communication links between them, and the type of communication protocol</li>
    <li>Develop from scratch the simulation environment Create a simulation environment that simulates the space segment, including the satellites VNFs, and the communication links between them (i.e., classes)</li>
    <li>Implement the optimization algorithm Implement an optimization algorithm that optimizes the VNF allocation based on the objectives and constraints defined in step 1</li>
    <li>Define the performance metrics to evaluate the optimization algorithm, such as the VNF utilization, the communication latency, and the power consumption</li>
    <li>Evaluate the optimization algorithm. Run the simulation with different optimization algorithms and evaluate their performance using the defined metrics</li>
</ul>
